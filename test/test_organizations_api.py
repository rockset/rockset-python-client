    REST API

    Rockset's REST API allows for creating and managing all resources in Rockset. Each supported endpoint is documented below.  All requests must be authorized with a Rockset API key, which can be created in the [Rockset console](https://console.rockset.com). The API key must be provided as `ApiKey <api_key>` in the `Authorization` request header. For example: ``` Authorization: ApiKey aB35kDjg93J5nsf4GjwMeErAVd832F7ad4vhsW1S02kfZiab42sTsfW5Sxt25asT ```  All endpoints are only accessible via https.  Build something awesome!  # noqa: E501
